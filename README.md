# Factorial-NX

A Nintendo Switch homebrew to calculate the factorial of a number.

Because 2^63 is the highest number the switch supports, you can't go over 25 factorial.

Note that I made this Homebrew only to learn how to use the basics of libnx and isn't really useful.
# Commands :
To make things easier, let's just say that the number you want to factor is called Jeffrey
  - a to add 1 to Jeffrey
  - b to subtract 1 from Jeffrey
  - x or y to set Jeffrey to 0
  - any trigger (r/l/zr/zl) to clear the terminal
  - Minus (-) to factor Jeffrey
  - Plus (+) to exit the Homebrew
  - Everything else will show you the 'help' menu
# What to know :
The letter shown before the value of the number is what executed the action :
  - (A) means you added 1 by pressing A
  - (B) means you substracted 1 by pressing B
  - (X) or (Y) means you set the number to 0 by pressing X or Y

Feel free to copy and distribute it as much as you want without any legal restrictions.

Could be optimized but then the code would be very ugly.
